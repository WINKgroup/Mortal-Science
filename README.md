# Mortal Science

by [La Scienza Coatta](http://github.com) & [WINK](http://wink.by)  

## Why science should be boring?

We think science is ["coatta"](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=coatto) therefore we want to show the world the real life of world foremost famous scientists, they were not _Library Rats_, they were _Coatti, Stacce!!!_

**Mortal Science** is a web based 2D fighiting game developed in **Unity** back in 2015, unlickily we never had the chance to finish it properly but we'd love everyone to join and hack around.

## Contribution

**The project is officially unmantained**, we invite you to fork and have fun, altough if you'de like to join the awsome Scienza Coatta team please refer to [@xxZap](https://github.com/xxZap) that is still the owner of the project and as much as possible will anser to your issues if you want to refactor and bring back to life the project.

## Stack

The project was built using Unity 3D 4.x, we're trying to recover the proper versione but at the moment try with this.

## LET'S FIGHT

### RUN

Do you wanna have fun fon't you? :)
You're lucky, there is a working version of the game in the `Builds/WebGL` folder.
You'll just need to host it on a local webserver.
If you can install nodejs we suggest

```bash
npm -g install static-server
static-server Builds/WebGL
```

Now just go on your browser to `http://localhost:9080/index.html`

### HOW TO FIGHT

### 1P

`WASD` or the Arrow Keys to move in the space  
`SPACE` to jump
`F` to punch and kick
`??` (when your Turbo is full)

#### 2P

If you have a joystick you can play against your friends on the same computer ü§òüèª
